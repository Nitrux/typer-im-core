# Introduction to Typer.IM (Instant Messaging) code
Typer.IM is a realtime chat system with Node.js and the socket.io library. The chat permits users to create private chat rooms that they can share with a friend. For avatars, it uses Gravatar.You can run the chat locally with nodejs (installing nodejs form your distribution repositories), or push it to Heroku or a different cloud service provider (where node.js is supported).

# How to run it?
First clone the project from the github repo. Be sure to have nodejs installed on your system already.
`cd typerapp`
`npm install`
`node app.js`

# How was this built?
