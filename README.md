# Introduction to Typer.im's code
Typer.im is a realtime chat system with Node.js and the socket.io library. The chat permits users to create private chat rooms that they can share with a friend. For avatars, it uses gravatar. 
You can run the chat locally with node, or push it to heroku or a different cloud service provider.
You can try it for free at typerapp.herokuapp.com

# How to run it?
First clone the project from the github repo. Be sure to have nodejs installed on your system already.
cd typerapp
npm install
node app.js

# How was this built?
This code is based on the tutorial of Nick Anastasov [http://tutorialzine.com/2014/03/nodejs-private-webchat/]. We have modified the look and feel of the app along with some tweaks like joining a session box and mailing the URL generated to a friend.
